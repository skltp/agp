skltp-agp
=========

agp is the core component for building an skltp aggregating service.

An aggregating service provides one incoming interface for a consumer to invoke. The call is then routed to all appropriate producers. The service then aggregates the individual responses to one single response which is returne to the consumer.

Note that the agp component is bound to a specific version of the [skltp platform](https://skl-tp.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SKLTP/Release+information)
